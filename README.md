# Datadog for JetBrains IDEs

The [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) plugin helps improve software performance by providing code insights in the IDE
based on real-time observability data.  The plugin is for developers that use Datadog products including 
[Log Explorer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/), [Error Tracking](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/), [Code Security](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/code_security/), the [Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/), [Test Optimization](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/) and [CI Visibility](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/) to monitor their services.

### Plugin Features

The **Logs** integration shows observed logs in the source code editor,
and provides links to the [Log Explorer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/) to view logs generated by a specific line of code.

The **Code Insights** feature helps you find and fix runtime errors from [Error Tracking](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/), library and runtime code vulnerabilities from [Code Security](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/code_security/), flaky tests detected by [Test Optimization](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/), and more.

The **Continuous Profiler** helps you to reduce latency and lower cloud costs by highlighting code that uses the most CPU time, allocates the most memory, triggers the most exceptions, or consumes high amounts of other resources.

The **CI Test Runs** feature opens the [CI Visibility Explorer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/explorer) to show recent runs for any test.

The **[Static Analysis](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/code_security/static_analysis/)** engine, running locally, analyzes your code against predefined rules to detect and
fix problems before you commit changes.
